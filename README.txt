Credit Risk Data Analysis  was group project that me and 3 other colleagues had to complete during our fourth week of the  bootcamp. 

We took the dataset from Statlog which is https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/144/statlog+german+credit+data

We did the data cleaning using pandas functions such as .replace,map function etc.. Then we export it as a CSV.

In order to analyse the data we used groupby in pandas with aggregate functions.
With the results from the functions we have created some visualizations also.

Afterwards, as part of the project, we created a presentation in which we shared the step that we took to finish it and the results. The presentation can be found here:
